# Escherichia_Coli
Programming Task
The story
Once upon a time, scientists discovered a certain species of "Escherichia Coli" that followed a
magically precise pattern in their reproduction process. In the research papers the mathematical
model of reproduction is described with these four principles:
• Pre-condition: Each E. coli bacterium can be alive or dead and have up to eight neighbors,
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonal adjacent.
• Principle (1): In an ideal two-dimensional world a new bacterium is born when it has three
neighbors.
• Principle (2): In contrast a bacterium dies when it is surrounded by more than three
neighbors.
• Principle (3): Luckily a living bacterium can survive when it is close to two or three neighbors.
• Principle (4): Unfortunately with less than two neighbors a bacterium will die as well.
Your task
Please write a small program that can consume bacteria colonies (data sets) with different initial
states and calculate the next state(s) for the given colony based on the four principles observed by
the scientists.
Your constraints
§ Use a version control system: Create a new empty repository on GitHub and add your code
changes in small, well commented commits
§ Apply the TDD development cycle: Write tests first, do a commit, add the according
implementation, do a commit, refactor...
§ Use these technologies: Java 8 with JavaDoc comments, JUnit 4 and Mockito for writing
tests.
§ Apply timeboxing: Set yourself a timer of 90 minutes. When the time is up, just send us a
link to your GitHub repo. (It is not required to come up with a holistic solution for the task.)
§ Bonus: Providing a GUI for the visualization of the bacteria states is optional.
Good luck!
